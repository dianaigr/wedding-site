  "aboutSectionGroom": "João was born in 1988 and grew up in the small village of Trouxemil. He studied Computer Science at Coimbra University. These days, João lives in Dublin, where he works as Software Engineer. When he’s not busy upgrading a database or doing presentations to clients, you’ll often find him diving into DIY projects or tinkering with small electronics. He’s also an avid scuba diver and has been skydiving for over ten years.",

  "aboutSectionBride": "Diana was born in 1989 and grew up in the small village of São João do Campo. She studied Design and Multimedia at Coimbra University. These days, Diana lives in Dublin, where she works as a UI Engineer. Outside of work, Diana’s happiest when she’s doing something hands-on or adventurous. She has a soft spot for arts and crafts (you’ll often find her sketching, sewing, or trying a new DIY project), and she’s also a bit of a thrill-seeker—whether she’s diving beneath the waves on a scuba adventure or galloping through a field on horseback. More recently, she’s been growing her own vegetables in a small allotment, where she finds joy in gardening and the simple pleasure of watching things grow.",

  "travelSectionStayDescription": "If you need a place to stay, Coimbra have a lot of hotels to choose from. We recommend the downtown area (are near the river), as there are a lot of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The top 3 hotels that we recommend are: NH Coimbra Dona Ines, Vila Galé Coimbra and Oslo Hotel. In our wedding night we will stay at the NH Coimbra Dona Ines, if you want to stay with us or near by.",
  "travelSectionTransportTitle": "How to get there",
  "travelSectionTransportDescription": "If you arrive in Portugal at Lisbon or Porto, you can always catch a train or bus that stops in Coimbra. The best way to move around is by car, but you can easily get a taxi/Uber on the train and bus stations to the hotel where you are staying. If you are taking the train, choose the high speed train or the intercity ones, or it will take a full day to get there in a regional train.",
